        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in Wisconsin, where snowy winters and warm, green summers shaped my early memories. Standing 5'9", Iâ€™m a D1 student-athlete, but my journey in track started much earlier, at age 10. Track has been more than just a sport for me; itâ€™s been a teacher. Over the years, Iâ€™ve learned patience, focus, and the value of pushing myself. Being a college athlete means balancing intense practices, competition schedules, and academics, and itâ€™s shown me that growth often happens in those challenging, in-between moments. Track has taught me that each race is more than a performanceâ€”itâ€™s a test of dedication, grit, and self-belief.
My family has shaped so much of who I am. My dad, a Black man born in the 1950s, had his own remarkable path as a professional athlete in the NFL. His journey was groundbreaking, not only for his accomplishments on the field but also as a Hall of Fame inductee. Growing up, I saw how much work went into his success, and how, even in retirement, he carries himself with humility and pride in his roots. Watching him taught me that greatness doesnâ€™t come easily and that dedication and passion are essential. His achievements have always inspired me to push further and to see what Iâ€™m capable of.Then thereâ€™s my mom, who came to this country as an immigrant. Her story has taught me a different kind of resilience, one that has to do with navigating a new world, making sacrifices, and finding strength in building a life for herself and her family. Sheâ€™s a grounding force in my life, reminding me of the importance of holding on to family, culture, and values. Between my parents, Iâ€™ve learned that success isnâ€™t just about accolades but also about staying true to who you are and honoring where you come from.
<br><br>

        Outside of my sport, I have a softer, creative side. Baking has become a favorite way to unwind and reconnect with myself. The process is almost meditativeâ€”measuring, mixing, and waiting as something new comes together. Itâ€™s a comforting contrast to the intensity of track, where everything is about speed. Baking gives me a space to slow down, to create, and to share something Iâ€™ve made with others. Music is another part of my life that I treasure, whether itâ€™s familiar songs or new discoveries. Both baking and music bring me balance and remind me of the beauty in slowing down.My personal style reflects my appreciation for calm and beauty; Iâ€™m drawn to pastel colors and have a special fondness for hibiscus flowers. Pastels feel soft and peaceful to me, a quiet comfort in a busy world. Hibiscus flowers hold meaning for me too. They remind me of growth and connection to nature, of moments where life is about simplicity and peace.
<br><br>

        In all, my life can be summed up with values of a blend of ambition, family legacy, and small joys. Track keeps me driven, but my family and creative interests keep me balanced. Iâ€™m learning to embrace both my competitive side and my softer side, to appreciate where I come from, and to stay open to wherever the next chapter might lead.
